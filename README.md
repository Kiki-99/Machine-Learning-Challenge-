# Machine-Learning- Exoplanet Exploration #


##Background##

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.  To help process this data, you will create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

##Conclusion##


As the graph presented above, it shows that the Random Forest model accuracy is higher than SVC model accuracy. However, training model duration was about an hour for Random Forest and 5 minutes for SVC with less than 100K samples. Therefore, if the model creation takes time and resources used into consideration, the SVC model tend to perform well within a limited budget and time.
